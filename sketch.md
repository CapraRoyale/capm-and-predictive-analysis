- Use:

  - Pyviz
  - Panel
  - Plotly Express
  - HVplot
  - 6-8 visualizations

- Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute in class

- Use one new python library that hasn't been covered in class

- Create a README.md in the repo

  - With writeup summarizing your major findings

    the relevant plots

OPTIONAL

- Use an API

  - Preferably with data relevant to your primary research question

PRESENTATION

- Questions you found interesting and what motivate you to answer them
- Where and how you found your data
